# "virtual"/"reference" entrypoints
- allow datapacks to define entrypoints that are just handles to other entrypoints (i.e. entrypoints of dependencies)
- ex: {id:'foo', represents:{pack_ref:'bar', id:'baz'}}
    - entrypoint orderings that use 'foo' would actually just be referencing bar:baz internally.
- these entrypoints do not call entrypoint tags, they are simply a handle for other packs to use in ordering.
- this would have pretty error-type & auxilary data ramifications.
