# Hooks
- add hooks :)

# Libraries
- a LIBRARY is defined as a that has no *observable* behavior on its own. i.e., (excluding latency) a non-op player has *zero* way to differentiate between a world with <A> and a world without <A> if <A> has no installed dependents.

# 'latest' and 'this' URLs
- split 'url' into 'url.latest' and 'url.this'.
- 'this' should be the exact version (i.e. github release/commit/branch), while 'latest' should be the main/latest version link (i.e. github main branch)
